# MDVRP
I simulated an MDVRP paper which is A tabu search heuristic for periodic and multi-depot vehicle routing problems
Please refer to the website for the meaning of data sources  http://neumann.hec.ca/chairedistributique/data/README.TXT
what I realize is a part of MDVRP(multi depots vehicle routing problem) in the article
the code uses python
the conclusion after simulation is that:
  we will reach the best answer or the answer which is close to baseline a relativeli small size questions
  but we got some bad simulation when we deal with bigger size problem while somtimes reachs 6 times result to baseline
 In a word,it is meaningful in some areas and worthy whit recording.
